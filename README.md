# Swapi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run "php -S http://localhost:8080 -t ./src/api/" to set up the API endpoint.

## Misc
I've started by implementing directly with the SWAPI from Javascript but figured out you might want to see a small PHP sample, so I've modified the code to accomodate for that
I know the code is not optimal in its current state, but since I'd never worked with Angular before and had to learn it from the ground up, I think the end result isn't too bad
Note that I also found a complete React.js integration on Github, but figured that's probably not what you were looking for as an assessment, here's still the link for it https://github.com/robertbg/swapi-react
